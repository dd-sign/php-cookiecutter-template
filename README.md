# Cookiecutter template for a php composer package

Hi! I'm your first Markdown file in **StackEdit**. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. Once you have finished with me, you can create new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.

# Installation

First install [CookieCutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). 
After that run `cookiecutter https://github.com/dd-sign/php-cookiecutter-template.git` and fill in the variables.
